# easy-server-actions

This workflow is triggered on a push event to the master branch and consists of a single job with four steps. The first step checks out the code, the second step sets up Node.js, the third step installs the dependencies, and the fourth step runs the server.

You can customize this workflow to suit your specific needs. For example, you might want to run different commands depending on the type of event (e.g. a push to a different branch, a pull request) or run additional steps for testing and deployment.
